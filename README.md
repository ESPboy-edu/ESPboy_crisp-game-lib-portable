# crisp-game-lib-portable

Minimal C-lang library for creating classic arcade-like mini-games running on devices and browsers (Experimental).

To make the [crisp-game-lib](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib) work on small devices, the library is implemented in C.

The goal now is to get it running on the [M5StickC PLUS](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit).

[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) also makes it possible to run [games written in C](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-portable/blob/main/src/c/game.c) on the browser. ([DEMO](https://abagames.github.io/crisp-game-lib-portable/build/))
